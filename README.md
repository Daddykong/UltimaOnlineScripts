# Ultima Online Scripts
Scripts for Ultima Online web client automation. Seems like they are all behind blog logins and other things so making my open and available.

## [Auto Heal](Auto_Heal.js)
Checks player health and heals depending on skill and criteria. Default is 80% health for bandage heal and 60% for Greater Heal/Close Wounds. Need to add logic for movement and other checks so it's less disruptive.

## [Pet Heal](Pet_Heal.js)
Auto heals you pet as long as you aren't moving and are in range with the right resources/skills.

## WIP [Auto Miner](Auto_Miner.js)
Attempts to mine an area around the player and smelt it on the back of a fire beetle. Checks for a pixaxe and equips it, makes one if you don't have one but have tools/resources. Still working on this one so probably non-functional. You'll have to at the very least do the walking around to avoid auto resource harvesting.

## [Auto Logger](Auto_logger.js)
Chops wood and drops it on the ground. Assumes you have an axe equiped and doesn't stack the piles. This for looking for amber/bark/etc. You have to do the walking around, no automated resource gathering.
